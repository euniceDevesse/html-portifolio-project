<h1>The Best Movies According to Eunice</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Ashiqui 2</h3>
<p>A great Love Story</p>

<h3>Sinners Wanted</h3>
<p>I loved this movie because it showed God's love through a person</p>


<h3>The pursuit of happiness</h3>
<p>This one was my favorite. It showed real-life, no-cut how sometimes life can be 
    hard. But even then, when you think all is lost, there's still hope.
