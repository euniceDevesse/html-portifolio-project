<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eunice, I'm a Computer Science student at Evora University. I started this
  web Development bootcamp because I want to have more 
  technical skills and apply the knowledge I have to build 
  projects. I'm very fascinated about creating webpages because 
  the main purpose to create an application or a system is that people 
  can actually use them. And one of the things we have to 
ensure as developers is to provide a good customer experience 
a good interface for the clients so that they can interact with more 
ease with the applications. My goal is to one day have my own brand and 
create my own website that will help me manage my future business and also 
to help other entrepreneurs to generate more profit, transforming 
their business into digital ones.

<p>As for hobbies I like dancing, cooking, singing and reading</p>
